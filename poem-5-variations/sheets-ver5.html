    I GREW UP WITH SOME TYPE OF MUTISM,
    AND AT AGE 3, I HADN'T SAID MY FIRST WORD.
    MY DAD TOOK ME TO A DOCTOR
    , FEARING THAT I HAD A HEARING PROBLEM 
    THE DOCTOR LOOKED AT ME AND TOLD HIM,
    "SHE HAS NO PROBLEMS,"
    "BUT SHE'S TOO SLOW TO BE BILINGUAL."
    "I RECOMMEND RAISING HER ENGLISH-ONLY,"
    "NOT ONLY WILL IT HELP HER, BUT IT ALSO WILL IMPROVE YOUR ENGLISH."         
    MY DAD WAS A BROKE GRAD STUDENT AND HAD ONE MATTRESS.
    HE LET ME SLEEP ON THE BED WHILE HE SLEPT ON THE FLOOR,
    ONLY CUSHIONED BY SHEETS.
    WAKING UP TO MY DAD IN PAIN,
    I OFFERED TO SWITCH PLACES,
    CLAIMING THAT MY BODY WAS STRONGER THAN HIS.
    LAYING ON HIS SHEETS,
    I WONDER IF MY SHORTCOMINGS WEIGH HEAVY ON HIS BACK.
